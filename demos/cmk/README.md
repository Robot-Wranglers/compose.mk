These files are written in CMK-lang, a superset of `make` that provides **native syntax** for various idioms that `compose.mk` provides.

All the `*.cmk` files in this directory run as part of the test-suite.

These files are *not* well commented, because most are adapted directly from `demos/*.mk`, i.e. their counterparts in implemented in classic Makefile.  See the [parent folder](../) for functionally equivalent code that's less pretty.

See the main documentation [here](https://robot-wranglers.github.io/compose.mk/), and especially the [compiler and dialects documentation here](https://robot-wranglers.github.io/compose.mk/compiler).
