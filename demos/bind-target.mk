# Demonstrating idiom for container-agnostic target dispatch,
# where the target always run from the container, but does not 
# care where it is called from.
#
# Part of the `compose.mk` repo. This file runs as part of the test-suite.  
# See also: http://robot-wranglers.github.io/compose.mk/container-dispatch
#
# USAGE: ./demos/bind-target-2.mk

include compose.mk
$(call compose.import, file=demos/data/docker-compose.yml)


# Decorator-style idiom.  
# This binds together a container, a "public" target, 
# and a "private" target.  The public-target becomes the main interface;
# the "private" target runs inside the named container, and has the same
# name but uses a "." prefix.  
my_target:; $(call compose.bind.target, debian)
self.my_target:
	echo hello container `hostname`

# Test that target still works, no matter where it's called from.
