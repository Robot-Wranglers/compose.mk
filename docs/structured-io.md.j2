### [Structured IO](#structured-io)
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

An annoying lack of structured output options for `make` is something that it has in common with lots of other[^8] classic unix tools.  And if you're working with Makefiles, then you're probably sad about the missing support for keyword-args.  

Part of the explanation for this is just that a Makefile might be using any random tools with any kind of output format, but that's sort of inevitable for automation.  The other part is just a missing approach to idioms and tools, and `compose.mk` can help with that.  

!!! commentary "Terminology"
    *"Structured"* is intentionally vague here, and there's a few ways it's applicable to basic features in `compose.mk`. Usually [structured just means means JSON](#structured-io-basics) [^6].  There is also support for a concept of [stream types](#structured-io-stream-types-pipes), which isn't *really* typed, but at least lets you tell markdown content from image content, newline-delimited vs space-delimited, etc.  And in terms of datastructures, there is [basic support for stacks and stages]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/stages), and [basic support for keyword-args](#argument-parsing)  For things like sets datastructures, see also the (unrelated) [GMSL](https://mxe.cc/gmsl.html) library.

The main benefit of the approach that `compose.mk` takes to structured data comes from **exposing tools like [`jq`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq), [`jb`](https://github.com/h4l/json.bash), and [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) without explicitly depending on them.**  How does that work?  Basically `compose.mk` will use local tools if they are available, and fall back to using dockerized versions of them if necessary.  Other than that, `compose.mk` tries to stay out of the way of `jq` and `jb` and let them do what they do.

{#The `compose.mk::stream` module, aka the [**`stream.*` target namespace**]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api#api-stream) adds basic support for working with streams, including newline/comma/space delimited streams, common use cases with JSON, etc.  Most of the utilities here are in the form of make-targets that are intended to be used with pipes (i.e. they read from stdin).

#### Structured IO: Basics
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Before we get into code examples, let's introduce basic principles with the command line.  

The `jb`[^3], `jq`[^4], and `yq`[^5] tools are so much revered, they are wrapped as top-level entrypoints.  

```bash  {.cli_example} {.command-line}
# Output JSON using `jb`
$ echo key=val | ./compose.mk jb
```
```bash {.cli_output}
{"key":"val"}
```
```bash  {.cli_example} {.command-line}
# Parse JSON using `jq`
$ echo key=val | ./compose.mk jb | ./compose.mk jq -r .key
```
```bash {.cli_output}
val
```
```bash  {.cli_example} {.command-line}
# Alternate approach, outputting JSON without input-pipes.
# Fine for simple stuff, not suitable for more complicated use cases.
$ ./compose.mk jb key=val foo=bar
```
```bash {.cli_output}
{"key":"val"}
```

Wrapped top-level entrypoints are documented in more detail as part of [tool mode]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview/#proxy-wrappers).  

-------------------------------

Inside a project Makefile, we can always use direct calls to `compose.mk` as seen above, or recursive calls to `make`.  This is often good enough, but if arguments to these tools get complicated then quoting could get sketchy, or determining a path to `compose.mk` could be tricky, etc. 

Luckily there are equivalent forms that are more idiomatic, still use local tools if available and fall back to docker if they are missing, and spawn fewer processes:

{{site.embed_demo('demos/structured-io.mk', 
    bottom_right=site.link_mirror(
        "demos/cmk/user-dialect.cmk",
        link=mkdocs.site_relative_url+"/compiler/#user-defined-dialects"),
    github=github)}}

*Now `make emit | make consume` is doing basic IO with JSON,* and we haven't added any new dependencies.  To actually get assignments for input variables in a way that's more automatic, see also the [parsing-arguments section](#argument-parsing) which builds on this example.

Besides using JSON for structured output somewhere at the *end* of a pipeline for output, you can use it internally for target input as well.  In terms of style, it is certainly *unusual* for targets to use pipes like this, but it's definitely worthwhile for, well, structure.  (*The alternative to this is environment variables, and then you have to worry about variable scopes, so statelessness here is a major advantage.*) 

Since you could also say that this goes part of the way towards emulating "keyword arguments", it also has the benefit of generalizing targets as [something closer to "functions"]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/style/#targets-as-functions).

From here you'll probably want to provide user-feedback and status messages **without** wrecking pipe-safety, so see also the section on [logging facilities](#logging-facilities).  For a look at structured IO in action, you also might like to check out [the workflow demos](#workflow-demos).

#### Structured IO: Stream Types & Pipes
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

The `compose.mk::stream` module, aka the [`stream.*` target namespace]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api/#api-stream) is full of targets that can help to handle common tasks with streams.  

Such targets work fine in [stand-alone mode]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview).  Inside a project Makefile, we can always use direct calls to `compose.mk`, or recursive calls to `make`, but most targets are *also available as macros*.  Using macros looks tidy and is easier to type, but the main benefit is as an optimization, because this removes the need for extra processes.

As a really simple example, targets that have to deal with streams will begin with `cat /dev/stdin` to capture input and start a pipeline, but this can be rewritten as simply `${stream.stdin}` for readability.

The above isn't exhaustive; see the [full stream API]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api/#api-stream) for other helpers.

#### Structured IO: Parsing, Patterns, & Nushell
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

A related topic is nushell, which you might be familiar with already if you're looking to expand your scripting toolbox and working around a lack of types in bash.  Whether you're a fan or never heard of it, you might be interested to know that `compose.mk` provides some helpers for accessing related features.  See the examples below.

{{site.embed_demo('demos/structured-io-nushell.mk', github=github)}}

Via the generic and dynamic targets, you can craft any kind of pipeline that nushell supports natively.  See nushell [official docs](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/categories/conversions.html) for more inspiration.  See also the related parts of the `compose.mk`, for example [here]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api/#streamparsecolumns) or [here]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api/#streamparsepatterns) and the more general [tool mode docs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview).
