### Reflection Support
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

[Reflective programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior.

Features like [CLI help]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/cli-help) and [automatically generated API docs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api) require that `compose.mk` has at least *some* ability to parse its own contents.  

And if we need that kind of ability, why not allow for parsing of other Makefiles?  As another applied example, see the [zero-config TUI documentation]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/zero-config-tuis/), which makes use of {{site.api_link('mk.include',mkdocs,arg='fpath')}}.  

Most of the meta-tooling that's available is somewhere in the [`mk.*` target namespace]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api-mk).

#### Makefile Metadata 
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

For metadata parsing, you can use the `mk.parse/<fname>` target, and get back targets, target chains, target docs, etc.  

{{site.api_link_many(['mk.parse'],mkdocs)}}

For testing, there is a super lightweight `demos/no-includes.mk` Makefile included in the repository for situations like this. Like the name suggests, it doesn't actually include or use `compose.mk` in any way.

```bash {.cli_example}
$ ./compose.mk mk.parse/demos/no-include.mk
```
```json {.cli_output}
{
  "clean": {
    "file": "demos/no-include.mk",
    "lineno": 13,
    "chain": [],
    "type": "file",
    "docs": [""],
    "prereqs": []
  },
  "build": {
    "file": "demos/no-include.mk",
    "lineno": 14,
    "chain": [],
    "type": "file",
    "docs": [""],
    "prereqs": []
  },
  "test": {
    "file": "demos/no-include.mk",
    "lineno": 15,
    "chain": [],
    "type": "file",
    "docs": [""],
    "prereqs": []
  },
}
```

*Under the hood, the heavy lifting for Makefile-parsing uses a dockerized version of the  [`mk.parse` tool]({{jinja.vars.mkparse_repo_url}}).*


#### Validation and Planning
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Validation of external Makefiles is used as part of code-generation and [compilation]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compiler), but it's also exposed for general use.

```bash {.cli_example}
$ ./compose.mk mk.validate/Makefile mk.validate/compose.mk
```
```bash {.cli_output}
 ✱ mk.validate // Makefile .. ok 
 ✱ mk.validate // compose.mk .. ok 
```

#### Reading Defines
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Reading `define ... endef` blocks from makefiles is important for several different `compose.mk` features that rely on embedded data.  And crucially, the contents of those blocks **must not be mangled**, escaped, interpolated, etc.

```bash {.cli_example}
$ ./compose.mk mk.def.read/Dockerfile.stream.pygmentize
```
```Dockerfile {.language-dockerfile .cli_output}
FROM ${IMG_ALPINE_BASE:-alpine:3.21.2}
RUN apk add -q --update py3-pygments
```

This feature is the foundation that all sorts of other stuff is built on, including support for [polyglots]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots) and [the embedded tui]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/embedded-tui) as well as [inlined Dockerfiles]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/raw-docker), etc.

{{site.api_link_many(['mk.def'],mkdocs)}}

#### Grabbing Symbols
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Reading defines is the most common need, but you can also get the expanded value of arbitrary symbols using `mk.get`.  This is sometimes useful for previewing what macros actually do.. for example to show the implementation of `${stream.nl.to.comma}`:

```bash {.cli_example}
$ ./compose.mk mk.get/stream.nl.to.comma
( cat /dev/stdin | awk 'BEGIN{ORS=","} {print}' | sed 's/,$//' )
```

For a more practical example, see [this section]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compiler/#about-dialects) of the compiler docs.

#### Pattern-Matching on Targets
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

There are various ways to enumerate available targets for the current runtime, either restricting it to targets defined in the local file, or adding targets from `include` as well.  

One nice thing about this is the ability to easily dispatch *all targets matching a given pattern*.  

{{site.embed_demo('demos/flux.star.mk', github=github)}}

See also the API docs for {{site.api_link('flux.star',mkdocs,arg='pattern')}}.

#### Dynamic Includes and Targets
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

To a certain extent, `compose.mk` can do *runtime* modification of `make` itself (or at least simulate it).  Under the hood, this works by using code-generation to create a new Makefile just in time, and then [turning execution over to it]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/signals/).  Also somewhat related is [the interpreter]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/signals/#inheritance-interpreters), and [the CMK compiler]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compiler).

**Create a new target dynamically.** Here's an example that creates a new target on the fly, assigning it to an existing target that simply returns success.  After the new target is defined, it can be used on the same command line.

```bash {.cli_example}
./compose.mk mk.let/foo:flux.ok foo
```
```bash {.cli_output}
 ✱ mk.let // foo:flux.ok // Generating code .. ./.tmp.5xdPP3008 
 Φ flux.ok // succeeding as requested! 
```

--------------------------------

**Dynamic includes.** Suppose you want to script with `compose.mk`, but the project makefile does not `include compose.mk`.  You can mix together automation APIs like this:

```bash {.cli_example}
$ ./compose.mk mk.include/demos/no-include.mk flux.timer/clean
```
``` bash {.cli_output}
cleaning
Φ flux.timer // clean // done in 0.000000000s 
```

What just happened?  Pulling apart this command, note that `compose.mk` offers no `clean` target, and `demos/no-include.mk` has no `flux.timer` target.  

The command above is similar to `make -f .. -f .. ` but retains the compose.mk API and signal-handling.  Or to put it another way, it executes the following Makefile just in time, then proxies commands to it:

```Makefile {.snippet} {.language-Makefile}
include compose.mk
include demos/no-include.mk
```

#### Forks, Guests, and Payloads
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

!!! note "Note"
    For bundling a lot of files and/or additional data, see also the [packaging demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/packaging), which provides similar capabilities via self-extracting archives.  This method is more lightweight and tactical.

For a few specific use-cases, `compose.mk` has the ability to fork it's own source code.  Helpers related to this are in the `mk.fork` namespace.  All unary targets require a filename, and nullary ones assume that input is on stdin.

{{site.api_link_many(['mk.fork'],mkdocs)}}

In each case, targets return the source code that results from *merging the given file-contents with the current source-context.*  Merges happen in specific sections, and each section has different semantics.

**Guests** 
: are expected to be Makefile source code.  It's appended after the main body of source, similar to [dynamic includes](#dynamic-includes-and-targets).

**Payloads** 
: are expected to be raw data, and this input is always wrapped with `define PAYLOAD .. endef`.  This could be JSON, [polyglot source code]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots), or anything else.

**Services** 
: are expected to be docker-compose.  This input is always wrapped with `define SERVICES .. endef`, and afterwards [`_compose.import.string`]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/bridge/#inlined-embedded-from-string) is used, bringing all that [service scaffolding]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/bridge) into the root namespace.

You can use overrides in these sections together to **bundle projects as tools**, or to **bundle extensions + core libraries + related containers into a single script**.

The *average use-case* looks like this:

```bash {.cli_example}
# Output new executable script to "./tool.mk"
$ bin=./tool.mk ./compose.mk mk.fork/Makefile,docker-compose.yml

# Result is executable.
# Also has access to project automation library, 
# and all the tool containers have target scaffolding
$ ./tool.mk debian.ps
$ ./tool.mk debian.shell
$ ./tool.mk debian.dispatch/...
```
```bash {.cli_output}
..
```

Above, `mk.fork` is just helper that uses the `mk.fork.*` primitives, but you can also use them piecewise:

```bash {.cli_example}
# Starting with `compose.mk` as a base, create 
# a "forked" script that wraps the project makefile
$ cat Makefile | ./compose.mk mk.fork.guest > fork1.mk
$ chmod +x fork1.mk

# Use the fork to generate the next fork,
# this time setting default services from the docker-compose file
$ cat docker-compose.yml | ./fork1.mk mk.fork.services > fork2.mk

# Cleanup, rename result
$ rm fork1.mk
$ chmod +x fork2.mk
$ mv fork2.mk tool.mk
```
```bash {.cli_output}
..
```
