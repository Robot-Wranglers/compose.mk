### Reflection Support
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

[Reflective programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior.

As a simple example of why this is practical, features like [CLI help](#) and [automatically generated API docs](#) require that `compose.mk` has at least *some* ability to parse its own contents.  And if we need that kind of ability, why not allow for parsing of other Makefiles?  Most of the meta-tooling that's available for stuff like this is somewhere in the [`mk.*` target namespace](#).

#### Makefile Metadata 
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

For metadata parsing, you can use the `mk.parse/<fname>` target, and get back targets, target chains, target docs, etc.  

For testing, there is a super lightweight `demos/no-includes.mk` Makefile included in the repository for situations like this. Like the name suggests, it doesn't actually include or use `compose.mk` in any way.

```bash
$ ./compose.mk mk.parse/demos/no-include.mk
{
  "clean": {
    "file": "demos/no-include.mk",
    "lineno": 13,
    "chain": [],
    "type": "file",
    "docs": [""],
    "prereqs": []
  },
  "build": {
    "file": "demos/no-include.mk",
    "lineno": 14,
    "chain": [],
    "type": "file",
    "docs": [""],
    "prereqs": []
  },
  "test": {
    "file": "demos/no-include.mk",
    "lineno": 15,
    "chain": [],
    "type": "file",
    "docs": [""],
    "prereqs": []
  },
}
```

*Under the hood, the heavy lifting for Makefile-parsing uses a dockerized version of the  [`pynchon` tool]({{jinja.vars.pynchon_repo_url}}).*

#### Reading Defines
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Reading `define ... endef` blocks from makefiles is important for several different `compose.mk` features that rely on embedded data.  And crucially, the contents of those blocks **must not be mangled**, escaped, interpolated, etc.  This feature is the foundation that all sorts of other stuff is built on, including support for [polyglots](#) and [the embedded tui](#) as well as [inlined Dockerfiles](#), etc.

Related targets include: 

{{macros.api_link_many('mk.def',mkdocs)}}

Currently, if you want to embed data that includes tokens like "endef", you are sadly out of luck!

#### Grabbing Symbols
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Reading defines is the most common need, but you can also get the expanded value of arbitrary symbols using `mk.get`.  This is sometimes useful for previewing what macros actually do.. for example to show the implementation of `${stream.nl.to.comma}`:

```bash 
$ ./compose.mk mk.get/stream.nl.to.comma
( cat /dev/stdin | awk 'BEGIN{ORS=","} {print}' | sed 's/,$//' )
```

For a more practical example, see [this section]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compiler/#about-dialects) of the compiler docs.

#### Pattern-Matching on Targets
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

There are various ways to enumerate available targets for the current runtime, either restricting it to targets defined in the local file, or also adding targets from includes.  

One nice thing about this is the ability to easily dispatch *all targets matching a given pattern*.  See the API for {{macros.api_link('flux.star',mkdocs,arg='pattern')}}, or the following example of how it's used in the test suite:

```Makefile 
{{open('demos/inlined-dockerfile.mk','r').read()}}
```

#### Dynamic Includes and Targets
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

To a certain extent, `compose.mk` can do experimental *runtime* modification of `make` itself (or at least simulate it).  Under the hood, this works by using code-generation to create a new Makefile just in time, and then [turning execution over to it]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/signals/).

For example, here's an example that creates a new target on the fly, assigning it to an existing target that simply returns success.  After the target is defined, it can be used on the same command line.

```bash 
./compose.mk mk.let/foo:flux.ok foo
```

--------------------------------

As another example, how about mixing `compose.mk` functionality with an existing Makefile that *does not actually `include compose.mk`*?

```bash 
$ ./compose.mk mk.include/demos/no-include.mk flux.timer/clean
```

Pulling apart this command, note that `compose.mk` has no `clean` target, and `demos/no-include.mk` has no `flux.timer` target. The command above basically creates and this Makefile just in time, and proxies commands to it.

```Makefile
include compose.mk
include demos/no-include.mk
```
