## Intro 

This demo is really just a variation on [many other ones]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka) that are using inlined data and container-definitions, but this case is an instance of [a custom containerized interpreter]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots/#custom-containerized-interpreters), and also demonstrates *custom interpreter invocations*.

### Theorem Proving 
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Realistically most people are not sitting around and wondering whether they can prove Euclid or GÃ¶del[^1] by using some wild [matrioshka doll]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/matrioshka) of a Makefile.  But then again, people do get up to all kinds of weird things. ðŸ¤”

For the purposes of this demo, we'll use `compose.mk` to take the [Lean4 prover](https://leanprover-community.github.io) for a test drive, and for starters just prove the law of the excluded middle.

It's fun, self-contained, and marginally practical, partly because more academic tools like lean frequently do not have official containers, and partly because this is part of a [larger demo about notebooking]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/notebooking).

### Lean Demo
