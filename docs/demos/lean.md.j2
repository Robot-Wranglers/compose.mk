## Theorem Proving in a Makefile??
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Realistically most people are not sitting around and wondering whether they can prove Euclid[^1] or GÃ¶del[^2] by using some wild [matrioshka doll]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/matrioshka) of a Makefile.  But then again, people do get up to all kinds of weird things. ðŸ¤”

--------------

For the purposes of this demo, we'll use `compose.mk` to take the [Lean4 prover](https://leanprover-community.github.io) for a test drive, and for starters just prove the law of the excluded middle.

It's fun, self-contained, and marginally practical!  Partly because more academic tools like lean frequently do not have official containers =P, but mostly because this is part of a [larger demo about notebooking]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/notebooking).  **Note that this demo is big,** so if you're not interested in running the notebooking demo later then you may not want to run this one.  Lean/lake/mathlib toolchain here takes significant time to build, and the image on disk afterwards is ~10gb.


!!! tip "Tip"
    This demo is really just a variation on many others that are [using inlined data and container-definitions]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka) and [working with foreign languages]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots) but this case is an instance of [a custom containerized interpreter]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots/#custom-containerized-interpreters), and also demonstrates *custom interpreter invocations*.


The lean demo comes in 2 flavors. The [first one](#lean-demo) is using `compose.mk` as a library, i.e. pure Makefile. The [second version](#lean-demo-cmk) uses `compose.mk` as an interpreter, i.e. [CMK-lang]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compiler), which helps to clean up the syntax a bit and clarify intent.  Otherwise the two demos are exactly the same.
