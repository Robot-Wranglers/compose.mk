### Inlined Compose Files

```Makefile
{{open('demos/inlined-composefile.mk','r').read().strip()}}
```

<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

{% include "demos/inlined-docker-files.md.j2"%}

<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

### Extending Inlined Docker Files 

Inlined containers can actually be extended with other inlines, but notice again the `compose.mk:` prefix which is used as a "repository".

```Makefile
{{open('demos/extend-inlined-dockerfile.mk','r').read().strip()}}
```

### Passing Inlined Data-Structures

Building on the [Custom Automation APIs](#) demo, let's embed an ansible playbook, pass *that* into an embeddded container.

```Makefile
{{open('demos/ansible-playbook.mk','r').read().strip()}}
```

## How it Works 

Most of this stuff hinges on multi-line defines, plus the [ability of `compose.mk` to handle reflection](#), which is possible because it has some ability to parse its own contents.  See the API for [*`mk.*`*]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api#api-mk) and [*`docker.*`*]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api#api-docker) for more details.  

Note also that the [*`mk.def.*`* targets]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api#api-mk) leave the data inside the defs completely unmolested, which means that there's no requirement for escaping the contents, and things like `$` are always left alone.  This also means the **content is fairly static**, and not typically amenable to pre-execution templating.  It *is* possible to work around this, but that's an even more crazy idea than the rest of this is, so it is left as an exercise to the reader. =P
