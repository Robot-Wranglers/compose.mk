## Matrioshka Automata
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

The [language overview page]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/language) discusses how `compose.mk` is secretly a programming language, even though it's perfectly fine to think of it terms of [a library]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/standard-lib) or [a tool]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview).  More to the point though.. compose.mk is a matrioshka language, and maybe the *first one that's actually intended to be useful*.

--------------

Matrioshka language
:  Matrioshka languages can be identified by their program forms, which will have multiple, distinct 'phases' with different syntactic and semantic rules. There are often two phases; the first gives a set of rules, and the second provides objects on which those rules are to be applied. *[--esolangs wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Matrioshka_language)*

--------------

For `compose.mk`, the "objects" are containers or container specs that might be inlined or external, and/or [foreign code]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots#foreign-code-as-first-class).  The "rules" are tasks or task-groups.  First-class support for these as primitives turns out to be especially useful for things like [wrappers]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview#tool-wrappers), [tool-factories]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/custom-automation-apis/#map-ansible-modules-to-targets), and even [app-factories]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/advanced-tuis) as seen in the rest of the site documentation.

This page is about identifying a through-line for the various more concrete work elsewhere, and you'll probably appreciate that if you prefer overviews that focus less on applications and more on **theory, architecture, and patterns**. If you want to take in a few simple and concrete matrioshka demos before you continue reading, [see instead this index of demos]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka).

### Matrioshka Idiom Basics
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Typically matrioshkas in `compose.mk` use a variation on the working definition from earlier, and they have the following structure:

1. **First phase:** declares a set of runtimes *(image tags, container definitions inlined or external, etc)*
1. **Second phase:** implement some tasks *(make targets)*
1. **Third phase:** maps tasks and/or task-groups onto runtimes

Sometimes the second phase is optional and we skip straight to phase 3. *(For an example of that, see the declarative style for [low-config TUIs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/low-config-tuis) with no need for target bodies.)*

Using basic [container dispatch idioms]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/container-dispatch) with external files is *matrioshka-like*, and almost all of [the polyglot demos]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/polyglots) are very simple matrioshkas that define (or just mention) a runtime & execute foreign code there. 

More involved matrioshkas usually have [inlined containers or data]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka), and they come in a few distinct categories that all have individual demos:

* [Inlined Dockerfiles]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#inlined-dockerfile)
* [Extending inlined Dockerfiles]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#extending-inlined-dockerfiles)
* [Inlined compose files]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#inlined-compose-files)
* [Passing inlined data structures]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#passing-inlined-data-structures)

### Has Science Gone Too Far?
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Of course, any place you can use embedded stuff with `compose.mk` is a special case, and nothing prevents you from using an external file.  But a determined individual can make a mess of anything, so it's probably worth pointing out that there are reasons for matrioshka-dolling that aren't totally insane.

{{macros.img_link("mad-science.png", mkdocs, "90%")}}

Here's a few arguments that suggest matrioshka-dolling has some legitimate use-cases:

* Sometimes having nested containers or data is just a way of keeping demos or prototypes *tight and small*, because being self-contained is the most legible or instructive.  On a related note, this is actually a pretty good format for a bug report / minimum reproducible example for some complex systems.
* Since tool containers tend to be small and change infrequently, being self-contained reduces change-related friction that you usually get with external files, external repositories, and external registries.
* Being self-contained is also at least *correlated* with other nice things like *stability and reproducibility*.

The rest of this page develops more interesting arguments in terms of fancy stuff like *patterns, idioms, and metalanguages* but the simple justifications above are actually very practical.  Just don't be antisocial by embedding a gnarly and frequently-changing 300-line Dockerfile into your team's Makefile, and you'll be fine ;) 

See the [design philosophy docs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/but-why) for a more detailed long-format dicussion of this type of thing.

### Matrioshka-Bridge Pattern
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

The previous section on [idiom basics](#matrioshka-idiom-basics) links several demos that focus on inlining or "embedding" containers and data.  A more interesting topic is the kind of bridge-building projects that you can see in [the ansible demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/ansible) and the [the justfile demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/just).  

-------------------------------

{{macros.img_link("escher-birds.jpg", mkdocs, "90%",align="center")}}

-------------------------------

Both of these demos are instances of a general pattern that goes like this:

1. **Describe a foreign toolchain.**  *(e.g. image tags, container definitions inlined or external, etc)*
1. **Drill a tiny hole through the matrioshka layers**, exposing or "lifting" something useful by abstracting away the fact that the task actually happens in a container.
1. **Better yet, lift something useful *that is parametric*** and then you have a *bridge*.
1. **Combine bridges at the level of `compose.mk`** to easily express ideas across systems.
1. **Compose bridges or groups of bridges**, using `flux` for workflows, `tux` for TUIs, etc.

**If you don't need to combine systems, you can actually stop after step 3,** and you have something like a "tool factory", where you can wrap the interface of something else and potentially change it. Summarizing the [ansible demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/ansible), we lifted ansible's whole [adhoc feature](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/command_guide/intro_adhoc.html) up out of the container, making it available to the host that doesn't have Ansible.  We also exposed and actually changed the default interface, insisting on JSON, providing aliased entrypoints for common use-cases, etc.  By using [compose.mk's support for packaging/compilation]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/package) it's even more obvious that you can spin off this whole effort as a stand-alone tool, or several tools.  *This is an example of using the matrioshka-bridge pattern to create a tool factory*.

**By the time you get to step 4, the possibilities for composition are surprisingly powerful, expressive, and flexible**, in large part because the [homoiconicity](#homoiconic) we discussed earlier starts to pay off.  Summarizing [the justfile demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/just), embedding a justfile is incidental since we could easily work with an external one, but again the interesting part again is a bridge across layers.  We lift part of the `just` interface, then besides changing/exposing that interface, we actually wrapped it and compose our way to new functionality.  As a result.. we end up with an interactive task selector in just one line.

**Step 5 is where the real magic happens,** and the demos mentioned so far are just hints.  Demonstrating the potential for this seriously under realistic circumstances starts to want more tools and larger use-cases.. which is a challenge for brief examples.  See the [platforming demo for a sketch]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/platform), or the [notebooking demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/notebooking).  See also a preview of the *(under construction!)* sister project [k8s-tools.git]({{jinja.vars.k8stools_docs_url}}) which uses `compose.mk` to automate cluster-lifecycles using more complex orchestration across a bigger toolbox.

### Advanced Matrioshka Idioms 
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

In the previous sections, we've looked at demos, idioms and patterns at differently levels of complexity.  But some people might wonder.. is this really significantly different than say, heredocs[^1] or random libdocker offerings in other languages? [^2] 

The answer is *yes!*, because besides better options for structuring code and attempting to treat containers as "first class" objects, `compose.mk` is also fluent about data and control flow *across layers*.

-------------------------------

{{macros.img_link("escher-stairs.jpg", mkdocs,"90%")}}

-------------------------------

As one example, [stage stacks]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/stages) allow targets to represent operations on shared datastructures, and this is one one way to accomplish message-passing across matrioshka layers.

Since `compose.mk` tool-container invocations [default to volume-mounts for the working directory and the docker socket automatically]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/raw-docker/#tool-container-defaults), things like [structured io]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/standard-lib#structured-io) can work reliably anywhere.  One consequence of this is a kind of "late binding" style, where basically you don't necessarily have to think much about whether tasks run on the host, or run on containers.

As a pretty extreme example of "fluency" across matrioshka layers, check out the [makeception demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/makeception), where we use `compose.mk` to embed 2 container definitions and to build and steer them, and shows some practical usage of [stage stacks]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/stages).  What's really unusual about this example though, is that even *the build process* itself is encapsulated inside the same file: rather than jamming bash in the Dockerfile, provisioning tasks are expressed as normal targets and executed as usual.

For an advanced example in service of a more conventional use-case, you might want to take a look at the [notebooking demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/notebooking), which uses 3 different containers (a formal-methods toolkit) to augment the behaviour of a 4th container (a jupyter lab server).

This might not seem like much, but we're already far beyond the flexibility of things like [bash heredocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) or most libraries that do docker hand-holding.  ^[2]

For those that just want to skip to practical examples, using basic [container dispatch idioms](#) with external files is matrioshka-like, and almost all of [the polyglot demos](#) are simple matrioshkas that define a runtime & execute foreign languages there. 

**For demos that more directly focus on embedded containers and data**, here's a running index:

* [Inlined containers containers and data]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka) 
    * [Inlined docker files]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#inlined-dockerfiles)
    * [Extending inline docker files]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#extending-inlined-dockerfiles)
    * [Inlined compose files]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#inlined-compose-files)
    * [Passing inlined data structures]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/matrioshka#passing-inlined-data-structures)
* The [Theorem Proving demo](#) embeds a lean4 runtime, theorem, and code.
* The [Custom Automation API demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/custom-automation-apis.md) wraps an Ansible runtime, then customizes it and exposes a different interface
* The [Justfile demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/just.md) wraps a just-runner and a just-file, then customizes it and exposes a different interface

The rest of this page is dedicated to general discussion of matrioshka design and idioms, so that the demos can remain small and focused.
