## Installation
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Just copy the `compose.mk` file and  make it executable:

```bash {.cli_example}

$ cd myproject 

# Download the compose.mk automation lib
$ curl -sL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robot-Wranglers/compose.mk/master/compose.mk \
    > compose.mk

# Make it executable
$ chmod +x compose.mk

# Now equivalent to `make -f compose.mk ...`
$ ./compose.mk ...
```

If you have `make` and `docker`, that's all the setup you'll need for stand-alone [tool mode]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview) usage.  While it's not really necessary or recommended.. you can always copy it to a bin folder too if you want.  *(See the [forks and versioning section](#forks-versioning) for more details.)*

Note that since [various containers]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview/#tool-wrappers) are only pulled on demand, initial usage can be slow, but subsequent runs can take advantage of cache.  Read on for details about tighter integration with projects.

### Project Integration
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

If you're looking to integrate with existing automation or you brought your own tool containers, you'll probably be interested in setting up the [Make/Compose Bridge]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/bridge) or preparing for [Container Dispatch]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/container-dispatch).  See that full documentation for more discussion, or if you already know what you're doing, read on for the copy/paste stuff.

#### Makefile Integration
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

A quick example of what your project Makefile should look like:

```Makefile {.snippet} {.language-Makefile}
# Include compose.mk for access to target API and macros.
include compose.mk

# If you brought tool containers, you'll want to import them.
# Call the bridge-building macro to get targets for each service.
$(eval $(call compose.import, docker-compose.yml))

# At this point, scaffolded targets are defined for 
# the tool containers mentioned in the compose file.
# Now you can dispatch any task to any tool container.
test: \
	tool_container_name.dispatch/self.test

self.test:
	echo hello world from container `uname -n -v`
```

#### Docker Compose Integration
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

Working with docker compose is optional if you're just interested in [stand-alone mode]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview/) or the [standard library offerings]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/standard-lib).  And if you *are* using docker-compose, then simple access to tools in containers from your docker-compose files will *just work* for many use-cases, via Makefile integration in the last section and [scaffolded targets]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/bridge).

However.. more complicated use-cases will need a volume-mount for your project directory so that tool containers can read/write files, and, [using container dispatch]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/container-dispatch) means that your tool containers need `make` and `bash`.

Here is some fairly complete boilerplate that's usually a good starting place:

{{macros.embed_demo('demos/data/docker-compose.yml', github=github, class='{.snippet}', type='yaml')}}

This example above is typical, but not necessarily minimal, so let's discuss a few things about it.  

**Regarding base images,** there's a good chance your tool-container already includes `make`, and you don't need to add packages at all.  But if you're looking for a reasonable base-containers that include `make` and will help you avoid initial package updates with `apt` or `apk`.. you might consider things like [golang containers](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/tags), [gcc containers](https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc/), or [`debian/buildd:bookworm`](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/buildd).

Next, a few tips and tricks about the docker-compose config details:

1. **Use defaults-with-overrides in `FROM` lines** to stay versioned but still keep some flexibility. 
1. **Use `dockerfile_inline` to quickly extend a base-container**, without adding an extra Dockerfile to your repository.  Tool-containers rarely change once established, and having a separate file and separate git/docker repos for everything can get tedious.  
1. **Use yaml inheritance with anchors,** i.e. `&base` and `<<: *base`.  This is a good trick to keep compose files DRY and as simple as possible.  
1. **Provide a few optional keys just for clarity.** Things like `hostname` clean up logging, and even if `entrypoint` isn't used by software it can help humans who are trying to debug.
1. **Correct config keys for `working_dir` and `volumes` are crucial for project file IO,** which might include reading your project `Makefile` if you're using container dispatch.
1. It's optional, but **there are cases where you'll want `docker` to be available inside tool-containers** and you also might want to share the hosts docker-socket.[^1]  The boilerplate above goes half way, defaulting to using a volume mount but stopping short of actually installing docker.  

### Compatibility Notes
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Platforms used in development for `compose.mk` include modern docker (say *25+*), recentish make (*3.8+*) and bash (*~5*) on both Linux and MacOS. Testing done in CI only uses Linux, and won't try every possible combination of versions.

In general though **the goal is to support most things you'll encounter in the wild**, including OSX, out of the box.  But with MacOS you may see some of the usual problems with certain invocations to non-gnu OSX default `sed` / `ps` / `xargs`, etc.  Please report issues!  

Simple usage of `compose.mk` should work without problems even using BSD tools instead of GNU ones, but for some [advanced usage]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/compiler) you'll probably encounter problems with MacOS's default `awk`.  

```bash {.cli_example}
# Install a GNU awk
$ brew install gawk
$ cp /usr/local/bin/gawk /usr/local/bin/awk
```

Typically local-bin comes before /bin in PATH, so this should leave your base installation untouched but still prefer gawk by default.

Opting in to GNU tools on MacOS in general is a matter of taste, but might be worthwhile. See documentation for example [here](https://gist.github.com/skyzyx/3438280b18e4f7c490db8a2a2ca0b9da) and [here](https://github.com/pkill37/linuxify).

### For Developers
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

For development on `compose.mk` itself, here's how you can clone the project, build related containers, and run the test suites.

```bash {.cli_example}
# Clone with SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:Robot-Wranglers/compose.mk.git

# Or clone with HTTP
$ git clone https://github.com/Robot-Wranglers/compose.mk.git

# Pull tool containers to do some early caching, run demos
$ make clean build 

# Run all demos (in Makefile)
$ make demos

# Run only CMK-lang demos
$ make demos/cmk
```

### Forks & Versioning
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Given the advice above to simply embed `compose.mk` directly into your project repositories, some people might be reading this and thinking **what if compose.mk changes upstream?**  

Eventually `compose.mk` will probably get a pypi installer option [^2] although of course that won't help much if you're not already in the Python ecosystem, and it does undermine the goal of minimalism.

For now, if you're really worried about this, you can always setup the `compose.mk` repository (or your fork of it) as a git submodule inside your project folder, but there's probably no need.  Fork-and-forget is a reasonable strategy here, and *removing dependency problems* rather than causing new ones is the goal.  For more discussion, see the section on [Contributing]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/contributing).

[^1]: For example, remote controlling the TUI relies on docker-sockets.  Also [tool wrappers]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview/#tool-wrappers) fall back to docker, so using them with [container dispatch]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/container-dispatch) means docker-in-docker.
