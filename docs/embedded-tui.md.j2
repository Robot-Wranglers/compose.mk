## TUI Overview

<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">
!!! info "Overview"
    A TUI is a **text user interface**.  Not to be confused with a CLI, a TUI implies something more like a "console application".  The TUI capabilities of `compose.mk` are best thought of as an **interface-builder rather than a specific interface.**  
    
    Support for the TUI requires no dependencies except for `make` and `docker`.  It aims for low-config and sane defaults, so for high level usage it [requires no configuration at all]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/zero-config-tuis).  Under the hood, the TUI uses a dockerized version of [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for core drawing and geometry.


There's a few ways to describe what the TUI actually *does*.

* Map `make` targets onto `tmux` panes.
* Map containers (inlined, or from external compose files) onto `make` targets
* Map *containers* on to panes.

And if you're already using `compose.mk` to [build custom]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/just/) [automation APIs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/demos/custom-automation-apis/), you can map those onto tmux panes too.

### TUI Gallery
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

For the impatient, here's a small gallery that show-cases the type of stuff you can do with the TUI capabilities that `compose.mk` offers.  

*( You can click any of the demos to make it bigger. )*

* For a quick test to get a look at the TUI yourself, try running `./compose.mk tux.demo`.
* For a from-scratch walk through, see [the TUI Demo]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}).  
* For low-level API reference, see the [`tux.*` targets]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api/#api-tux).  
* For TUI-related stand-alone tools, see [the loadf docs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/loadf) and the [tool wrappers docs]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/tool-overview/#other-wrappers).

### Batteries Included

<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

Besides a dockerized `tmux`, the basic pre-configured components of the TUI are things like [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) for dynamic session management, and overridable defaults for [tmux themes](https://github.com/jimeh/tmux-themepack/), [tmux plugins](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), [keybindings](#tui-keybindings), etc.  

These components are configurable, but not something that you necessarily have to think about.  Some notable effects of the "sane defaults" policy include:

* Click to open a new pane, or click to exit
* Leave the TUI by hitting the escape key *(if the embedded apps don't intercept the key)*
* Advanced layouts like spiral & fibbonacci, using [dwindle](https://github.com/sunaku/home/blob/master/bin/tmux-layout-dwindle)
* Status bar including details like user, pid, & working-dir 

These elements, plus access to other tools like [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) and [chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/), are all setup in the embedded `compose.mk:tux` container, which is built and used only on demand.

#### Default Keybindings
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">
!!! danger "Limitations"
    Keybindings are easy to change, but there's no way guarantee that such defaults won't collide with whatever existing applications you're trying to stitch together.  See the previous section for more details.

The TUI ships with some default keybindings that are aimed at keeping things pretty user-friendly even for those who are not already familiar with tmux.  

{{bash("pattern='*Default TUI Shortcuts*' make mk.parse.block/compose.mk") }}

### Layout Basics
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

We'll start by showing **how to map targets onto a specific pane orientation**, using the [`tux.open`]({{mkdocs.site_relative_url}}/api/#tuxopenarg) target-family.  For mapped targets, we'll use `flux.ok`, which has no arguments and simply succeeds without doing anything.

```bash {.cli_example}
# Specify a horizontal layout and pass in 3 targets
$ ./compose.mk tux.open.horizontal/flux.ok,flux.ok,flux.ok
```
{{macros.img_link("tux.open-h.png", mkdocs, "400px",class="cli_output")}}

Running this command shows some log messages detailing the startup process and the first time it runs you'll see the TUI bootstrapping itself (i.e. building the necessary support containers for running `tmux`).  (Afterwards it will be cached, so startup is much faster.)

After it starts, you'll see an interface like this, and it ran the `flux.ok` target for you, once in each pane.


```bash {.cli_example}
# Other equivalent forms
$ layout=horizontal ./compose.mk tux.open/flux.ok,flux.ok,flux.ok
$ layout=h ./compose.mk tux.open/flux.ok,flux.ok,flux.ok
```

#### Vertical Orientation
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

For controlling the default orientation, `tux.open.vertical` of course works in a similar manner as you can see below.

```bash {.cli_example}
# Specifies a vertical layout, and pass in 2 targets
$ ./compose.mk tux.open.vertical/flux.ok,flux.ok

# Other equivalent forms 
$ layout=vertical ./compose.mk tux.open/flux.ok,flux.ok
$ layout=v ./compose.mk tux.open/flux.ok,flux.ok
```
{{macros.img_link("tux.open-v.png", mkdocs, "400px",class="cli_output")}}

#### Spiral Orientation
<hr style="width:95%;border-bottom:1px dashed black;">

The main alternative to "horizontal" and "vertical" is called "spiral", and it looks like this:

{{macros.img_link("tux.open-s.png", mkdocs, "400px")}}

### Next Steps
<hr style="width:100%;border-bottom:3px solid black;">

These 3 layouts are enough for most use-cases, but `compose.mk` actually supports whatever `tmux` does and also whatever [dwindle](https://github.com/sunaku/home/blob/master/bin/tmux-layout-dwindle) supports.

Of course, `flux.ok` is not very interesting, but it is the *simplest* target.  We'll move into more practical examples in the following sections, and almost everything else we'll look at is some variation of the principles above.
